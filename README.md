### TomatoTomato

My inaugural project, TomatoTomato is a todo list app with an integrated pomodoro timer.

Development of TomatoTomato was challenging, but with the help of my mentor, resources from the Swiftful Thinking, and extensive use of the Swift documentation, I was able to publish the first version as an open-source project on GitHub.

**Things I learned:**

* How to manage CoreData by integrating it into an MVVM structure and write clear and concise CRUD functions. 
* Support for Dark mode, Landscape, and iPad using SwiftUI.
* Creating a Launch screen with Storyboard.
* How to  work with Timers and integrate them with ViewModels.
* I honed my skills with Navigation and List views as well.

Inspo is the simple app where you can get a random picture from the Harvard Museum collection for a dose of pure visual inspiration.

This project marked my first experience working with async images and utilising an Open API from the museum. This project was a tribute to my background in art history. 

**Things I learned:**
* how to work with AsyncImage to display images efficiently, 
* how to access and work with data from an open API, 
* how to incorporate gestures into my app using SwiftUI, 
* how to implement persistence in the networking layer to ensure a smooth user experience

### Capital Weather

Capital Weather is a simple weather app built for training purposes.  The app provides the current weather at the user‚Äôs location, and also allows the user to add and track weather in other cities using the search feature. While the app is simple in design, it was a valuable learning experience for me.

**The things I learned:**
* Utilising JSON decoding to fetch weather data from Open API.
* Working with User Defaults to save user-specific data.
* Implementing Scroll View and List Views for a better user experience.
* Adding search functionality to the app.
* Incorporating User Location for live weather updates.

## My learning journey üó∫

As a self and community-taught developer, I started learning to code with Apple Playground courses in early 2022. From there, I moved on to official Apple tutorials and documentation, and joined **Ladies of Code** coding club where I learned about TDD, design patterns, and ensemble coding. I also attended webinars and meetups with **Women Who Code** to further develop my skills.

During the summer, I worked on several projects with  my mentor, [@togramago](https://github.com/togramago), and spent time on Codewars. These experiences enabled me to design and build the apps in this portfolio using community resources such as Hacking with Swift, Kodeco (formerly Rey Wanderlich), StackOverflow, Sean Allen channel, and Swiftwul Thinking.

In the future, I aim to explore new frameworks, architectures, and technologies to enhance my skills and develop more powerful and sophisticated apps. I'm keen on trying out the **VIPER** architecture and refreshing my knowledge of **UIKit**. If you're interested in collaborating with me, don't hesitate to reach out!
